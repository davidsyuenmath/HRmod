Notes from Jerry's laptop:

g++ BPunified.cpp -o allBP.out -g -O0 -I/sw/include
-I/usr/local/include/flint -lflint -lgmp

Note: The include of the complex multi precision library may need to
be commented
out, to:

//#include <mpc.h>

-g is for enabling debugging
You can try removing that and see if that speeds up the program.
I think I used this on a server to debug a memory leak.
-O0 is setting the optimization level to 0
I think I also needed this to debug the memory leak. So you can also remove
this to see if the program will run faster.

So:

g++ BPunified.cpp -o allBP.out -I/sw/include
-I/usr/local/include/flint -lflint -lgmp
