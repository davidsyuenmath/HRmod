Notes from Jerry's laptop:

g++ BPunified.cpp -o allBP.out -g -O0 -I/sw/include
-I/usr/local/include/flint -lflint -lgmp

Note: The include of the complex multi precision library may need to
be commented
out, to:

//#include <mpc.h>

-g is for enabling debugging
You can try removing that and see if that speeds up the program.
I think I used this on a server to debug a memory leak.
-O0 is setting the optimization level to 0
I think I also needed this to debug the memory leak. So you can also remove
this to see if the program will run faster.

So:

g++ BPunified.cpp -o allBP.out -I/sw/include
-I/usr/local/include/flint -lflint -lgmp

====  IF INSTALLING mpfr IS REQUIRED ====
In a terminal window:
> ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null
> brew install mpfr
If you get an error of the form:
  dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libmpfr.4.dylib
then try renaming the newer version to the older version, for example:
  cp /usr/local/lib/libmpfr.6.dylib  /usr/local/lib/libmpfr.4.dylib
