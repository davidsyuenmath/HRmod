## A family of programs that compute eigenvalues by restriction to a modular curve.

Six programs. Hecke Restriction programs (BPHR, GQHR, BPTp2HR, GQTp2HR, TwHR) using mod arithmetic, and helper MakeWHJF. 

* Implements speed up theorems.  
* T2 versions of GQ and BP, but not Tw. 
* BPHR and BPTp2HR do Hecke restriction of Borcherds products.  
* GQHR and GQTp2HR do Hecke restriction of Gritsenko Quotients.  
* TwHR do Hecke restriction of a quotient where the numerator can include T2(Grit*Grit) and (Tweak*Tweak). 
* Also helper program MakeWHJF that makes and saves a weakly holomorphic Jacobi form that can be read by BPHR and BPTp2HR.
